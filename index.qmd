## Welcome to my Website

I am a Masters student in the political science department at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/) and the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship ([CSDC](https://csdc-cecd.ca/members/students/?studentid=547)). My research is in the sub-fields on **Canadian** and **comparative politics** and focuses on the causes and consequences of political polarization.
