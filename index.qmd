I am a Masters student in the political science department at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/) and the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship ([CSDC](https://csdc-cecd.ca/members/students/?studentid=547)). My research is in the sub-fields on **comparative** and **Canadian politics** and focuses on the causes and consequences of political polarization and quantitative methodology. My current research is supported by the *Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada* and the *Fonds de recherche du Québec - Société et culture (FRQ-SC)*. 

I previously revived a Bachelor's degree in Political Science from [Wilfrid Laurier University](https://students.wlu.ca/programs/arts/political-science/index.html).
